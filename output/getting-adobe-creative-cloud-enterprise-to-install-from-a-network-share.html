</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I've been fighting geting Adobe Creative Cloud to install properly from a LiteTouch deployment share. In my troubleshooting, I was always able to install the exceptions just fine, but the MSI package created by Adobe's Creative Cloud Packager would not run successfully from a network share. When I tried to log what was happening, I kept getting a 1603 error in the InstallFinalize step along the lines of the following:
<!-- more -->
{% codeblock lang:text MSI Log File %}
Action start 13:33:43: InstallFinalize.
CustomAction CADeploy returned actual error code 1603 (note this may not be 100% accurate if translation happened inside sandbox)
Action ended 13:34:15: InstallFinalize. Return value 3.
Action ended 13:34:15: INSTALL. Return value 3.</p>
<p>-- Lines Omitted --</p>
<p>=== Logging stopped: 4/2/2014  13:34:15 ===
MSI (s) (B4:2C) [13:34:15:574]: Product: AdobeCreativeCloud -- Installation operation failed.</p>
<p _="%" endcodeblock>MSI (s) (B4:2C) [13:34:15:574]: Windows Installer installed the product. Product Name: AdobeCreativeCloud. Product Version: 1.2.0000. Product Language: 1033. Manufacturer: Adobe Systems Incorporated. Installation success or error status: 1603.</p>
<p>In my experience, error 1603 usually means some sort of file access issue (either it is missing or you don't have permissions to access it). What was confusing was that when I ran the deployment from a local drive it was always successful. After searching forums and Google for many hours I decided to come up with my own workaround. I zipped up the "Build" folder in my created package, and then wrote a batch script to extract the Build folder to a temporary directory and then install from there. This method has worked every time. The only downside is that it is a bit slower than the method that should work (and used to when I created an Adobe CC package around the same time last year).</p>
<p>If you'd like to recreate my resolution:
  1. Download <a href="http://7-zip.org">7-zip</a> and extract 7z.exe and 7z.dll from the installer. 
  2. Copy these files to your Adobe CC package folder (same one that has <em>packagename</em>.ccp).
  3. Create a ZIP file of your Build folder in your Adobe CC package folder. Mine is just Build.zip.
  4. In your silent install script, just extract the Build.zip file to a temporary folder and install the MSI package from there.</p>
<p>You can use my own silent installation script to see how this is all done.</p>
